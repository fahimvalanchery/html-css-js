                        <p> From the client side to server to database, the mean stack uses the same code. Since all these technologies use the same Javascript, the web development process using MEAN stack becomes a breeze. The same applies to web applications as well which greatly reduces the strain resources 
                            both on the programmer and to the program itself by making it more flexible.</p>

                                        To start unlike SQL databases the MongoDB is a document database. 
                                        MongoDB does not need any predefined database schemas and rules to establish field regulations this leads to a speedy addition, deletion or editing of data.

                                        As mentioned before, using MEAN stack eliminates the need for the use of multiple languages. This makes the development of application 
                                        easy and also helps in the smooth running of the application such as reduced time for a page loading.

                                        MEAN stack is compatible with the operating system may be as long as it supports Node.js. The list includes MS Windows, MAC OS and Linux.

                            <p>All the above-mentioned advantages can translate into higher efficiency, productive employees and better allocation of resources from disk space to managing developer experts.Since MEAN is open source thus free, given the interest of many companies. 
                                It is acceptable to expect many upgrades and developments to Stack.</p>
